PyPubSub provides a publish - subscribe API that facilitates the development of 
event-based (also known as message-based) applications. PyPubSub supports sending and 
receiving messages between objects of an application, as well as a variety of 
advanced features that facilitate debugging and maintaining topics and messages
in larger applications. 

ATTENTION: the 3.x branch of PyPubSub is DEPRECATED! It only exists to support 
Python 2.7 applications. Upgrade your app to Python 3.6+ ASAP and use PyPubSub 
4+. Post on https://github.com/schollii/pypubsub for any issues. 

Install from current distro with "pip setup.py install" (ensure that pip runs
with Python 2.7).
