PyPubSub provides a publish - subscribe API that facilitates the development of 
event-based (also known as message-based) applications. PyPubSub supports sending and 
receiving messages between objects of an application, as well as a variety of 
advanced features that facilitate debugging and maintaining topics and messages
in larger applications. 

Note: ONLY USE the 3.x branch with Python 2.x! (actually, 2.7 only).

Install with "pip install pypubsub=3.4".
