# this file gets copied to wx/lib/pubsub folder when release to wxPython

For wxPython users: 

The code in wx/lib/pubsub folder was originally part of the wxPython source base, 
but was eventually moved into its own project, PyPubSub, hosted on SourceForge. 
The code in that folder is now taken from the repository on SourceForge. It is 
included as part of wxPython distribution for convenience to wxPython users, but 
pubsub can also be installed standalone (see installation notes at http://pypubsub.sourceforge.net). The PyPubSub website also has extensive documentation.

The WxPython wiki also discusses usage of pubsub in wxPython, but some of the code is date.
