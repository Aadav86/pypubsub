Main changes in v4.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Support Python 3.5 and 3.6
* Distribution via wheel
* Abandon support for Python 2.x and easy_install
* Abandon support for long-ago deprecated arg1 messaging protocol
* Added currying of subscribed listener args
* Use PEP 484 style of annotations throughout

The setuparg1.py and setupkwargs.py files have been removed. If your application
uses setuparg1.py, first upgrade to pypubsub 3.3 and following the instructions in
its documentation (http://pypubsub.sourceforge.net/usage/howtos/index.html)
to migrate your application to use the kwargs protocol. Once this
is done, you will no longer need setuparg1.py. You can then upgrade to pypubsub v4 and
your app should just work. If your application uses setupkwargs.py, simply remove the
import from your app. If you face any issues, please post on
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pypubsub.
