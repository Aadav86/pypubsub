Main changes in v4.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Support Python 3.5 and 3.6
* Distribution via wheel
* Abandon support for Python 2.x and easy_install
* Abandon support for (long-ago deprecated) arg1 messaging protocol
* Added currying of subscribed listener args
* Use PEP 484 style of annotations throughout

Consequences of these changes:

- If your app runs in Python 2.x, you cannot upgrade to pypubsub v4.
- If your Python 3.x application uses setupkwargs.py, simply remove the import statement
  from your app. Your app should run without further changes. If your app won't run
  after doing this, please post on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pypubsub.
- If your Python 3.x application uses setuparg1.py, this means you are using the
  long-ago deprecated arg1 API for messaging. Before upgrading to v4 pypubsub, you
  will have to migrate your app/package to use pypubsub's kwargs API. This is most
  easily done via pypubsub 3.3, which has functions and docs
  (http://pypubsub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/howtos/index.html)
  to help with this task. Once you have completed this migration, you should be able
  to upgrade to pypubsub v4 without further changes.
